# Base64 Encode / Decode Online
Hello, World! I created this project to practice and learn my coding skills. Things I learned:
- Learned more Tailwind
- Got better at CSS Grid
- Learned how to implement Dark Mode using Tailwind
- Improved on my React skills such as useEffect combined with Tailwind and setting the class to be dark
